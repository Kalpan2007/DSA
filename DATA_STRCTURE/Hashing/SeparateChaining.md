# Separate Chaining — Function-by-Function Deep Explanation 

This note explains **Separate Chaining** (hash table with linked-list buckets) *function-by-function* — in depth and interview-ready.  
It intentionally **does not** contain the full program source; instead it breaks down each operation (what it does, why, edge-cases, complexity, and interview tips).

---

## Quick context (one-liner)
Separate chaining stores, for each hash index, a **linked list (chain)** of keys. Common C++ types: `map<int, list<int>>` or `vector<list<int>>` for the buckets.

---

## Data structures & important behaviour notes
- `hashTable` type: `map<int, list<int>>` (or `vector<list<int>>`).
  - `map` lets us address buckets by index and the bucket is created on demand when using `operator[]`.
  - `list<int>` is a doubly-linked list; `erase(it)` is O(1) given an iterator.
- Hash function assumption: `h(k) = k % m` where `m` is table size (preferably prime).
- Important distinction:
  - `hashTable[index]` **creates** an empty bucket if `index` does not exist in the map.
  - `hashTable.find(index)` only checks existence and **does not** create a bucket.
  - Use `operator[]` when you *want* to ensure a bucket exists (e.g., `insert`).
  - Use `find` in `search` if you want to avoid creating empty buckets unintentionally.

# Function-by-function breakdown

Below each function we show: *purpose*, *step-by-step actions*, *why each step matters*, *edge-cases*, and *complexity*.

---

## 1) Constructor / Initialization
**Purpose:** set the table size `m` and prepare any initial state if needed.

**Typical signature:** `SeparateChaining(int m) : size(m) {}`

**What it does (stepwise):**
1. Store `m` in `size` (used by the hash function).
2. Optionally reserve bucket storage if you use `vector<list<int>>` instead of `map` (e.g., `buckets.resize(m)`), which avoids dynamic creation during inserts.

**Why:** choosing `m` determines the number of buckets. A good `m` (often a prime) reduces clustering and keeps average chain lengths short.

**Complexity:** O(m) if you pre-allocate with a vector, O(1) otherwise.

**Interview tip:** mention load factor α = n / m and that rehashing (growing `m`) is used in production hash tables to keep α low.

---

## 2) `hashFunction(int key)`
**Purpose:** map keys → bucket indices.

**Typical line:** `return key % size;` (or a better distribution function for non-integer keys).

**What it does (stepwise):**
1. Compute `k % m` to produce an index in `[0, m-1]`.
2. Return that index to identify which bucket to use.

**Why each step matters:**
- The hash function must be **fast** and **spread keys uniformly** across buckets.
- Choosing `size` as a prime often reduces collisions for simple modulo hashing.

**Edge-cases:** negative keys — if keys could be negative, use `((key % size) + size) % size` to ensure non-negative index.

**Complexity:** O(1).

**Interview tip:** show awareness that modulo is a toy hash function and explain how to generalize to strings or objects (e.g., polynomial rolling hash, std::hash).

---

## 3) `insert(int key)`
**Purpose:** add a key to the table (append to the chain at the bucket).

**High-level steps (and why):**
1. `index = hashFunction(key)` — find the target bucket.
2. Use `hashTable[index]` to get the bucket list (this will create the bucket if absent).  
   *Why:* on insert we usually want the bucket to exist so we can push into it.
3. Option A — **Allow duplicates**: `chain.push_back(key)` (O(1)).  
   Option B — **Prevent duplicates**: first `find()` the key in the chain; only `push_back` if not found.
4. Print/log the insertion (helpful for debugging and demonstration).

**Detailed rationale for each step:**
- We compute index so we never examine other buckets — correctness depends on doing this first.
- Using `operator[]` is convenient but note it may create an empty `list` entry in the map; this is intentional for inserts.
- Deciding whether duplicates are allowed is a design choice. Many textbook implementations forbid duplicates by checking the chain before insertion.

**Edge-cases & considerations:**
- Very long chains (high load factor) degrade performance; insertion becomes O(length_of_chain).
- Concurrent inserts require locks or atomic operations — out of scope for single-threaded examples.

**Complexity:** Average O(1), worst-case O(n) (if all keys land in the same bucket).

**Pseudo-snippet (short):**
```cpp
int index = hashFunction(key);
auto &chain = hashTable[index]; // creates bucket if needed
// optional: if (find(chain.begin(), chain.end(), key) == chain.end()) chain.push_back(key);
chain.push_back(key);
```

---

## 4) `search(int key)`
**Purpose:** determine whether a key exists in the table and optionally return its bucket or iterator.

**High-level steps (and why):**
1. `index = hashFunction(key)` — restrict search to the correct bucket.
2. Use `auto itBucket = hashTable.find(index)` to check if bucket exists.  
   *Why:* using `find` avoids creating an empty bucket when we only want to search.
3. If bucket missing → key not present (early return).
4. If bucket exists → iterate `for (elem : itBucket->second)` and compare `elem == key`.
5. If found → return `true` (or the iterator/position). If loop ends → return `false`.

**Why each step matters:**
- Early return when bucket is absent is a fast check to avoid unnecessary iteration.
- Using `find` (instead of `operator[]`) keeps the table clean from accidental empty buckets created by searches.

**Edge-cases & notes:**
- If duplicates are present, search returns true on first match. If you need positions of all duplicates, continue iterating to collect them.
- If keys are stored as complex objects, provide a proper equality comparator.

**Complexity:** Average O(1), worst-case O(n) per search.

**Pseudo-snippet (short):**
```cpp
int index = hashFunction(key);
auto itBucket = hashTable.find(index);
if (itBucket == hashTable.end()) return false;
for (int elem : itBucket->second) if (elem == key) return true;
return false;
```

## 5) `remove(int key)` — full stepwise explanation (in-depth)
You already provided a remove implementation; here’s a deeper breakdown and the *why* behind each line.

**Purpose:** find and remove the first occurrence of `key` in its bucket’s chain.

**Implementation steps, with reasoning:**

1. `int index = hashFunction(key);`  
   - Compute the bucket where `key` would be stored. We never search other buckets.

2. `auto itBucket = hashTable.find(index);` **(recommended)**  
   - Check if the bucket exists. Using `find` prevents creating an empty bucket when key is absent.
   - If `itBucket == hashTable.end()` → bucket doesn't exist → print "not found" and return.

   *Alternative:* `auto &chain = hashTable[index];` (this creates an empty bucket if none exists). This is fine but may leave empty buckets behind.

3. `auto &chain = itBucket->second;`  
   - Use a reference to avoid copying the whole list and to allow in-place modifications.

4. Traverse chain with an iterator:  
   ```cpp
   for (auto it = chain.begin(); it != chain.end(); ++it) {
       if (*it == key) {
           chain.erase(it);
           // Optionally: if chain becomes empty and you used map, erase the bucket:
           // if (chain.empty()) hashTable.erase(itBucket);
           return;
       }
   }
   ```
   - Why iterator? `list::erase(it)` needs an iterator to remove **that** node efficiently (O(1)). Using index-based erase (not available for list) or using `remove(value)` would iterate again or be less precise.
   - After `erase(it)`, the iterator `it` is invalidated - but `erase` returns the next valid iterator in C++11+ for some containers; for `list`, `erase` returns iterator to next element. In our simple remove, we `return` immediately so we do not need to use the returned iterator.

5. If loop completes: print "Key not found" — nothing to delete.

**Extra considerations:**
- **Remove all duplicates**: if you want to remove all occurrences, do not `return` after the first `erase`. Instead iterate with the returned iterator:
  ```cpp
  for (auto it = chain.begin(); it != chain.end(); ) {
      if (*it == key) it = chain.erase(it);
      else ++it;
  }
  ```
- **Cleaning empty buckets:** after removal, if the chain is empty and you are using `map`, you may `hashTable.erase(index)` to remove the empty bucket entry and keep the map tidy.
- **Iterator safety:** erasing using the iterator is safe for `list`. For other containers (e.g., `vector`), erase invalidates other iterators and is O(n).

**Complexity:** Average O(1) to find in short chains; worst O(n) if chain is long.

**Interview tip:** explain why `erase(it)` with an iterator is O(1) for `list` and why `operator[]` vs `find` matters for `map` when removing.

---

## 6) `display()` (how to show bucket contents)
**Purpose:** print bucket index followed by its chain (`NULL` terminator or `[empty]`).

**Recommended approach:**
1. Iterate `i` from `0` to `size-1`.
2. Use `auto it = hashTable.find(i)` to check if bucket exists and is non-empty.
3. If exists: iterate bucket list and print elements followed by `-> NULL`.
4. Else print `[empty]`.

**Why `find` here?** it avoids creating empty buckets during display (keeps map free of empty entries).

**Complexity:** O(m + n) to print every bucket and element (m = number of buckets, n = number of keys).

---

# Example — step-by-step small scenario
Start with `m = 7`, and insert keys: `{50, 21, 58, 17, 28, 35}`.

- `50 % 7 = 1` → bucket 1: [50]
- `21 % 7 = 0` → bucket 0: [21]
- `58 % 7 = 2` → bucket 2: [58]
- `17 % 7 = 3` → bucket 3: [17]
- `28 % 7 = 0` → bucket 0: [21, 28]
- `35 % 7 = 0` → bucket 0: [21, 28, 35]

**Search 28:**
- hash to index 0, iterate [21,28,35], find at second node → return true.

**Remove 28:**
- hash to index 0, find chain, iterate to second node, use `erase(it)` → chain becomes [21,35].
- Optionally if chain empty, erase bucket.

# Edge-cases, gotchas & interview talking points
- **Empty-bucket creation:** calling `hashTable[index]` in search or remove can create empty lists; prefer `find` for non-mutating operations.
- **Duplicates policy:** be explicit: allow or disallow duplicates. To disallow, check chain before insert.
- **Resizing and rehashing:** if `n` grows large, rehash to a larger `m` (and reinsert all keys). Explain amortized cost.
- **Alternative bucket structures:** `vector<list<int>>` (faster index access) vs `map<int, list<int>>` (saves memory if many empty buckets).
- **Memory locality:** `list` has poor locality; for cache-friendliness, consider `vector` buckets with careful erase strategy or `forward_list` if singly-linked is sufficient.
- **Thread-safety:** discuss locks per-bucket or lock-free designs in production systems.

# Quick checklist for interviews (what to say & demonstrate)
- Explain the hash function and why pick `m` as prime.
- State load factor α and how it impacts complexity.
- Show `insert`, `search`, `remove` step-by-step and talk about average vs worst-case costs.
- Mention practical improvements: rehashing, bucket data-structures (vector vs list), and duplicate policy.
- If asked to code: write a concise insert/search/remove using `vector<list<int>>` for clarity and performance.
